# BDev I/O Throughput Benchmark Pipeline
# Purpose: Measures sustained BDev I/O throughput
#   Full BDev I/O path: Continuous Allocate -> Write -> Free operations
# Each thread continuously performs operations until the duration timer expires
# Requirements: Chimaera installed in PATH
# Expected Runtime: Configurable via 'duration' parameter (default: 10 seconds)
